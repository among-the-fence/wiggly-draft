SKYCLAWS
Especially headstrong Blood Claws are reassigned to jump pack
wearing Skyclaw packs. Rebellious and free-spirited, Skyclaws seize
any opportunity to push their luck. They rocket forward fearlessly in
great loping bounds, chainswords roaring as they slay, plunging into
the enemy’s heart with reckless fury.
