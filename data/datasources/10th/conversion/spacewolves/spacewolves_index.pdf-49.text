MURDERFANG
A stampeding mechanical beast is unleashed from beneath the Fang
in times of need, its massively brutal claws tearing its foes limb from
bloody limb. The Chapter names it Murderfang. Its true identity is
unknown for its insensate snarling rages are bereft of speech; it is
known now only as a force of untamed destruction.
