BJORN THE FELL-HANDED
Most ancient of all Space Marines and last of the Company of Russ,
Bjorn the Fell-Handed has fought for millennia within a Dreadnought’s
sarcophagus. The Space Wolves revere Bjorn as a living link to their
deepest past, waking him only in times of dire need, and he still fights
as furiously as he did at Russ’ side.
