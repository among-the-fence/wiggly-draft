HARALD DEATHWOLF
Harald Deathwolf is attuned to the lupine beasts of Fenris as few
others are. The lair of his Great Company resounds to their howls, and
many of these wolves fight with his warriors. A peerless hunter, Harald
tracks his prey with speed and stealth, launching his ferocious strikes
from atop his giant Thunderwolf, Icetooth.
