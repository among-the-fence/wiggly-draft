WOLF GUARD
Earning their place through exceptional feats of arms, every Wolf
Guard is a heroic warrior chosen by their lord. They act as his council
and household companions, and when not tearing apart foes at his
side, they form bodyguards around other senior warriors or pursue
dangerous missions in their own right.
