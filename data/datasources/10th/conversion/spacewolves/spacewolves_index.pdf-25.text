CANIS WOLFBORN
The most feral of Harald Deathwolf’s veterans, Canis Wolfborn moves
with animalistic assurance. Believed to have been raised by a
she-wolf, Canis speaks to his brothers in snarls and growls, and on the
battlefield his frenzied rages, slashing claws and Thunderwolf’s jaws
are all the communication he needs.
