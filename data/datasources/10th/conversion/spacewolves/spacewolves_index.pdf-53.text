FENRISIAN WOLVES
Amongst the most vicious and intelligent predators in the galaxy,
Fenrisian Wolves accompany the sons of Russ to battle, following
them as the pack follows the alpha. Even the sleekest are as big
as a Human, yet they prowl silently before pouncing in a swift and
coordinated flurry of razor-sharp teeth and claws.
