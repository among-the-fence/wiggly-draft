GREY HUNTERS
With their instinctive raw aggression tempered – but never quashed
– by countless battlefield victories, Grey Hunters are patient, cunning
and adaptable. Some packs take and hold ground, unleashing volleys
of disciplined firepower, while others stalk the flanks. When the trap is
set, Grey Hunters leap in for the kill.
