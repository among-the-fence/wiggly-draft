KROM DRAGONGAZE
Belligerent, violent and seldom suffering anyone gainsaying his
bloodthirsty tactics, Krom Dragongaze is notoriously short of temper.
His fierce gaze is petrifying to lesser men, yet his critical eye seeks
deeds of valour and his Great Company boasts many veteran Wolf
Guard. Wildly competitive, Krom refuses to accept defeat.
