WOLF SCOUTS
Wolf Scouts are brooding stalkers and taciturn killers, at ease prowling
behind enemy lines or at a battle’s edges. Commonly experienced
battle-brothers rather than neophytes, Wolf Scouts employ patience
and guile in their roles as reconnaissance experts and forward
hunters, sniffing out isolated foes and falling upon them with fury.
