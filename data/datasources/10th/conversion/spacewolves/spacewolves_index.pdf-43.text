HOUNDS OF MORKAI
Daubed beneath their Phobos armour with runes of warding and
abjuration, Hounds of Morkai are hunters of psykers. Sniffing them
out with psycept detectors, these obsessed warriors emit uniquely
pitched howls. Runic circuitry augments their hunting call, disrupting
their prey’s powers and sowing fear before the kill.
