THE EMPEROR’S CHAMPION
A humble warrior touched by greatness, the Emperor’s Champion
strides to battle wreathed in divine light. The furious blows of the
enemy ring from his nigh-impenetrable Armour of Faith. In return,
the Emperor’s Champion seeks out the leaders of the foe and, with
sweeping blows from his Black Sword, strikes them down.
