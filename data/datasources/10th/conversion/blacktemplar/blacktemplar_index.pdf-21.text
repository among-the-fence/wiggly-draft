MARSHAL
Each Black Templars crusade is led by a Marshal. Similar in rank to
the Captains of other Chapters, Marshals are fearsome combatants
and paragons of strategic acumen. Ensuring a crusade’s purity and
success is a sacred duty, and Marshals fight with sanctified relic
weapons while acting as beacons of pious fervour for their warriors.
