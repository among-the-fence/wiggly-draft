CRUSADER SQUAD
Mingling Initiates and their Neophyte charges, led by a
battle-tempered Sword Brother, Crusader Squads combine maniacal
zeal with the posthuman might of the Adeptus Astartes. Often
equipped for the close-quarters fighting style favoured by the Black
Templars, they carry their crusade into the heart of enemy lines.
