CHAPLAIN GRIMALDUS
High Chaplain Grimaldus is a beacon of Imperial faith. His fortitude
is such that many of his brothers believe him invincible. His will is
singular, his zeal coldly furious, and his martial skill attested by the
trail of broken foes laid at his heels. His Cenobyte Servitors lurch to war
at his side, bearing with them holy relics of the faith.
