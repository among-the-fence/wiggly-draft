DEFF DREAD
Being wired into a Deff Dread affords strength, resilience and a
terrifying array of vicious weaponry. Of course, the reality of being
stuck in a metal box for life and drinking your meals through a straw
soon gets old, but the pilots’ resulting unhinged ferocity only serves to
make Deff Dreads all the more dangerous in battle.
