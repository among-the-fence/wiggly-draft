SQUIGHOG BOYZ
With their mounts snorting and saddlegitz hanging on for dear life,
Squighog Boyz thunder into the fight. They fling rokkit-propelled
stikkas, hitting with enough force to pierce plate armour, then employ
muscle, weight, momentum and sheer belligerence to squash those
foes still standing to a paste.
