BATTLEWAGON
No two Battlewagons are the same, for the Meks that build them can
never resist cobbling on armour plates, ramming spikes, assorted
dakka and random worky-gubbinz. However, all are rugged transport
tanks with the capacity to bear a vast number of angry Orks into battle
while shrugging off the worst the enemy can throw at them.
