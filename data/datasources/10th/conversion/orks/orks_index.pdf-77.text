MORKANAUT
Usually piloted by the exiled Badmek who built it, a Morkanaut is a
hulking combat walker with a dash of Mork-esque know-wotz applied.
Packed with all manner of glowy gubbinz, Morkanauts unleash their
arsenals of bizarre and deadly weapons in what their pilots think of as
displays of pure kunnin’ worthy of Mork.
