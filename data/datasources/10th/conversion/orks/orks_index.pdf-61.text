KOMMANDOS
No right-thinking Ork trusts Kommandos. They sneak up on the enemy
rather than charging in headlong, and have an unhealthy fascination
with very big knives and their application to people’s backs, throats
and guts. That said, having a band of Kommandos ambush the enemy
mid-battle definitely has its uses.
