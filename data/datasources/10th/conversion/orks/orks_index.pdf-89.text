The traditional tools of the Painboy help them to patch up even the
most mangled Orks and send them back into the fight. Helpfully, all
these gruesome surgical klaws, rippy saws and fat syringes also
serve as an expedient means of dismembering the enemy with – if not
surgical precision – at least a great deal of enthusiasm!
