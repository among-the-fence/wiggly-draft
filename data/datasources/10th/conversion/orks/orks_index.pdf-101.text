TANKBUSTAS
Tankbustas stalk enemy vehicles like game hunters. Rokkit launchas
to blast targets from range; high explosive tankhammers swung by
true short-term thinkers; short-fused bomb squigs strapped with
explosives; all help the Tankbustas to bring down their targets before
ripping oily trophies from the still-blazing wrecks.
