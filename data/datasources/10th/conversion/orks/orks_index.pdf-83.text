NOB WITH WAAAGH! BANNER
Entrusted to the warband’s most stubborn Nob, a Waaagh! banner
serves as a rallying point and a place for the Warboss to display his
favourite trophies, glyph plates and such. Should the ladz need some
encouragement to get stuck into a scrap, the banner also doubles as a
handy bludgeon to beat some ferocity into them.
