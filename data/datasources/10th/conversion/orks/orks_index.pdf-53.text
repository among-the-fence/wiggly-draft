HUNTA RIG
Welded, lashed and nailed together from enemy wrecks and
scavenged scrap, the Hunta Rig forgoes a Wurrboy wurrtower (much
to its crew’s relief). Instead it boasts an open metal deck and copious
grab-handles, the better for chanting and bellowing mobs of Beast
Snagga Boyz to ride along on the hunt.
