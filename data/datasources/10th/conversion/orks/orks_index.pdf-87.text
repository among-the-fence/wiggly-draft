The Painboss specialises in both the surgical care and
cyber-augmentation of squigs, and of those suffering squig-related
injuries. So as to provide their services ‘on the hoof’, Painbosses
augment themselves with piston-driven soopa-legz, monowheels and
the like – the better to deliver high-speed doktorin’.
