GHAZGHKULL THRAKA
To face Ghazghkull Thraka in battle is to die. Messily. He is a totemic
war leader of great kunnin’ and terrifying presence who enjoys the
personal protection of the Ork gods, not that he seems to need it!
Makari bears aloft the personal Waaagh! banner of Ghazghkull. There
isn’t a greenskin living who doesn’t fight harder in sight of that flag.
