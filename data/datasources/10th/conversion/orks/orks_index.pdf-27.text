BOSS SNIKROT
Boss Snikrot is a murderous ghost whose obsession with kommando
warfare has seen him transcend the cunning of his fellow Blood Axes
and achieve instead something nigh supernatural. By the time his
terrified foes realise he is upon them, the Boss is already opening their
throats with his rip-toothed blades.
