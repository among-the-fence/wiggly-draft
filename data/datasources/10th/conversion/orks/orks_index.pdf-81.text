NOB ON SMASHA SQUIG
The smasha squig has a skull so hard it can stave in armour and
pulverise bone. To compensate for a lifetime of perpetual concussion,
nature has furnished smasha squigs with virtually no brain power;
therefore only the most belligerent Nobz can keep these beasts
pointed at the enemy long enough to make impact.
