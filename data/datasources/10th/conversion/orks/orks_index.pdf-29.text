BOSS ZAGSTRUK
Plummeting from his kustom fighta-bommer at the head of his
infamous Vulcha Boyz, Boss Zagstruk hits the enemy like a four
hundred pound rocket-propelled missile of pure, belligerent fury.
Amidst the roar of his blitz missiles and the crunch of bone beneath
his cybork foot-klaws, bloody havoc ensues.
