MEGATRAKK SCRAPJET
Just because an Ork aircraft has lost a wing or two, doesn’t mean
some enterprising Speed Freek can’t find a tremendously violent use
for it. Megatrakk Scrapjets tear across the battlefield shooting hails
of rokkits before ploughing nose-drill-first through the enemy lines,
drivers bellowing with glee the whole time.
