BOOMDAKKA SNAZZWAGON
The Boomdakka Snazzwagon is a high-speed riot on wheels. Bristling
with dakka and swarming with anarchic greenskin crew, the vehicle
roars through the enemy lines in a storm of roiling smoke, whistling
bullets, incendiary burna bottles and shockingly foul language before
skidding around for another pass.
