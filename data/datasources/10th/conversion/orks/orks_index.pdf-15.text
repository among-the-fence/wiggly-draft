BIG MEK IN MEGA ARMOUR
For all that its weight is akin to wearing half a tank, mega armour is
incredibly resilient. Big Meks often build and wear it, adding unstable
kustom weaponry, force field projectors, crushing klaws or even
tellyport blastas that kill victims by beaming their component parts
across a wide area, much to the Orks’ amusement.
