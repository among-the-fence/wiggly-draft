BURNA BOYZ
The burna is a cutting torch intended for slicing up battlefield
wreckage. Serendipitously, it also works well when searing through
an enemy’s armour at close quarters, or, with a twist of its nozzle, can
instead belch a tongue of roaring flame over the foe. Needless to say,
the most pyromaniacally inclined Orks delight in doing both.
