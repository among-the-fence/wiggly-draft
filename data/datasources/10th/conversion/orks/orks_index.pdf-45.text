FLASH GITZ
Flash Gitz are despised by other greenskins for being self-important
show-offs with too much snazz and dakka for their own good. The Gitz
couldn’t care less, of course, delighting in ostentatiously brandishing
their over-the-top snazzguns before using them to utterly demolish the
enemy in a hail of shells, blasts and rokkits.
