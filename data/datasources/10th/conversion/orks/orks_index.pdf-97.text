STOMPA
Something akin to a bad-tempered, armour-plated mountain covered
in guns, the Stompa is a walking idol to Gork and Mork. It packs
enough firepower to level an enemy fortress or annihilate entire
formations of troops with a single volley, while anything unlucky
enough to get within reach is soon crushed flat.
