BIG MEK WITH SHOKK ATTACK GUN
The shokk attack gun opens a tunnel through the warp into its
target, then launches screaming Snotlings down it. The diminutive
greenskins rematerialise as a terror-maddened, clawing, biting swarm.
Needless to say if this happens in an engine, troop bay or – worst of
all – a living body, the results are swift and horrific.
