MOZROG SKRAGBAD
Mozrog and his squigosaur steed Big Chompa are so tough that they
can weather the worst any foe throws at them. In return, few enemies
survive for long once Mozrog tears into them with his kustom cybork
arm, Gutrippa. Those that do are doomed to be swallowed whole by Big
Chompa’s yawning, fang-stuffed jaws.
