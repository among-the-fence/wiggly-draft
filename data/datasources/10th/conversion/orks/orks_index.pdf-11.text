BEASTBOSS
It takes a ferocious and foul-tempered Ork to lead a stampede of
Beast Snaggas. Beastbosses possess these qualities in abundance.
Boasting cybork enhancements, wired-in targetin’ squigs and an array
of brutal combat weaponry, these roaring monsters can bring down
even the largest prey one-on-one.
