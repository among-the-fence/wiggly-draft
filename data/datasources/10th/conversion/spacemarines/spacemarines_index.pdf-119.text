IRONCLAD DREADNOUGHT
Clad with slabs of ceramite plating and equipped to rend ferrocrete
or reduce thick walls to rubble, the Ironclad Dreadnought has been
perfected for siege warfare. It is akin to a giant battering ram,
pummelling through enemy positions while flooding them with
burning promethium and torrents of mass-reactive bolts.
