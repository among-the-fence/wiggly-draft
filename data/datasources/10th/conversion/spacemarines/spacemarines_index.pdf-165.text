DESOLATION SQUAD
Desolation Marines specialise in unleashing widespread devastation
throughout the enemy ranks. Whether direct-firing warheads into
massed infantry or enemy armour, or raining salvoes down upon the
enemy with their castellan launchers, these warriors reap a grievous
toll amongst the foe.
