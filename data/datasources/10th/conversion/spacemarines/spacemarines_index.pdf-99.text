REIVER SQUAD
Rapid-insertion terror troops, Reiver Squads often deploy using
grav-chutes and directional fins to land with pinpoint accuracy.
Operating with near perfect stealth to reach the optimum location to
strike from, when ready they unleash their fury, surging forward with
augmented guttural roars and blasts of weapons fire.
