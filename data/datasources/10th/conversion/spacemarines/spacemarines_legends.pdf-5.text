As relics of a lost age of martial design, Contemptor Dreadnoughts are
exemplars of combat versatility. The best demonstration of this is the wide
array of weapon arms compatible with the Contemptor chassis, ranging
from conventional heavy weapons and power fists to some of the most
esoteric firearms still in use on the battlefields of the 41st Millennium.
