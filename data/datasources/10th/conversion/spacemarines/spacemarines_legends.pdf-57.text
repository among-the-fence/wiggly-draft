Tarantula Sentry Guns are automated weapon systems ideally suited
to area denial and deterrent roles. Equipped with simple logic engines
and fitted with either lascannons or heavy bolters, they can cut down
enemy troops or stop armoured vehicles in their tracks, placing minimal
demand on their operators’ attention.
