REPULSOR
Clad in advanced armour plating and armed for any battlefield
situation, the Repulsor not only transports its passengers safely,
it also provides superb fire support. Dangerous terrain is little
impediment to it, its ventral plates channelling gravitic energies that
crush obstacles beneath the vehicle’s mass.
