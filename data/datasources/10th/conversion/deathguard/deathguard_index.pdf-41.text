BLIGHTLORD TERMINATORS
Blightlord Terminators are formidably tough thanks to their
Cataphractii plate and Nurgle’s gifts, and are experts in breach
assaults, boarding actions and sudden teleport strikes. Due to long
periods spent aboard pox-ridden warships, they are saturated with
foulness, which pours off them to rot flesh and corrode metal.
