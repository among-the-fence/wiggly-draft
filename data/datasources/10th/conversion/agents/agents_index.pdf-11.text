ROGUE TRADER ENTOURAGE
Rogue Traders are daring explorers, ruthless conquerors and cunning
merchants, exploring and exploiting the uncharted regions of the
galaxy in the name of the Imperium. Their families bear a Warrant of
Trade, which helps to identify them as Imperial elites. Some command
whole armadas, while others have only a small retinue of followers.
