INQUISITOR GREYFAX
Inquisitor Greyfax is feared even by many in her own order, the Ordo
Hereticus. Devoid of mercy or remorse, she is an iron-willed warrior.
She is also a powerful psyker, with telepathic abilities that enable her
to detect lies in those she questions. Some brand Greyfax a dangerous
radical for this, but her commitment to the Imperium is undeniable.
