INQUISITOR KARAMAZOV
Inquisitor Karamazov is amongst the most ruthless and
uncompromising of the Ordo Hereticus. His actions have no guile or
subterfuge, and he has no time for clemency. Karamazov has led vast
crusading armies, as well as presided over the trials of heretics from
his Throne of Judgement – an ancient bipedal battle-shrine.
