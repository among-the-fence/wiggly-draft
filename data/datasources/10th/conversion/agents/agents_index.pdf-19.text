EXACTION SQUAD
The most experienced and level-headed Arbitrators form Exaction
Squads to hunt down and seize dangerous transgressors alive.
They do not hesitate to crush any who stand in their way, ruthlessly
bludgeoning them or cutting them down in blazes of heavy firepower,
never halting until their target is in custody.
