INQUISITOR COTEAZ
A puritan of the Ordo Malleus, Inquisitor Coteaz spends every waking
moment studying reports made by his countless agents, or facing
down daemons, heretics and aliens in open battle. He refuses to
harness the power of the warp for his own ends, wiedling it instead to
combat the daemonic and prosecute those who lack purity.
