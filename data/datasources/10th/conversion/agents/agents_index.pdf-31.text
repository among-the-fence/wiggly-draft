INQUISITOR
It is the Inquisitors’ task to investigate xenos plots, corruption,
mutation, heresy, cults, rogue psykers and anything else they deem
worthy of scrutiny. Such is their power, nothing is beyond their
authority and no one is beyond their justice. If they deem it necessary,
they can order the destruction of entire worlds.
