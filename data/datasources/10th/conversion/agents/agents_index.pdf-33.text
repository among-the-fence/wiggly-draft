INQUISITOR EISENHORN
Inquisitor Eisenhorn of the Ordo Xenos is a man of great willpower and
resolve. He will go to any lengths to preserve the Imperium, and for his
actions has been declared a traitor twice – he was found to be loyal on
both occasions. Eisenhorn is also a potent telepath, with the power to
compel individuals, or even groups, to follow his instructions.
