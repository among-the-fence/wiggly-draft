VINDICARE ASSASSIN
The muffled crack of a Vindicare Assassin’s exitus rifle is all that most
ever detect of its presence – that, and the spray of their victim’s brain
matter. They are lethal marksmen who find the perfect firing position
from which to pinpoint their quarry, while against more numerous foes
they swiftly rack up high body counts with shot after expert shot.
