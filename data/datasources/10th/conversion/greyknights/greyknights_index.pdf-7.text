KALDOR DRAIGO
The Supreme Grand Master of the Grey Knights, Lord Kaldor Draigo
enters battle directly from the warp itself and his resolute spirit
inspires his warriors to acts of high valour. He hunts down and slays
the spawn of Chaos with psychic fire and blows from the legendary
Titansword, its blade reforged with a purified daemon weapon.
