GREY KNIGHTS RAZORBACK
Razorbacks are sturdy armoured transports that combine speed with
the support of powerful heavy weapons, ideal for surgical strikes and
swift feints. Secure within its adamantine-encased hull, a squad of
Grey Knights can advance rapidly and strike exposed foes, while the
Razorback’s turret engages additional targets.
