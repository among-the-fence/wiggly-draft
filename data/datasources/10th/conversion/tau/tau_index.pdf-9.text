COMMANDER SHADOWSUN
Accompanied by advanced shield and command drones, Commander
O’Shaserra surges dynamically into battle. She is the master of the
Kauyon, laying cunning ambushes for her enemies then striking with
merciless fury. O’Shaserra spearheads these attacks from the front,
and every shot from her fusion blasters heralds another fallen foe.
