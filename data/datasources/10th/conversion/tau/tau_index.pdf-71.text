 Fortification: While an enemy unit is only within Engagement
 Range of one or more Fortifications from your army:
 ■ That unit can still be selected as the target of ranged
    attacks, but each time such an attack is made, unless it is
    made with a Pistol, subtract 1 from the Hit roll.
 ■ Models in that unit do not need to take Desperate Escape
    tests due to Falling Back while Battle-shocked, except for
    those that will move over enemy models when doing so.
 Tidewall Cover: Each time a ranged attack is allocated to a
 model, if that model is not fully visible to every model in the
 attacking unit because of this Fortification, that model has
 the Benefit of Cover against that attack.
 Tidewall Defence Platform: If equipped with a Tidewall
 defence platform, this Fortification has a Wounds
 characteristic of 15.

TIDEWALL SHIELDLINE
In keeping with the Code of Fire, the Tidewall Shieldline
provides a mobile fortification that can redeploy during
battle. Its refractive field absorbs enemy fire, while its design
allows entrenched Fire Warriors to ride the shieldline to a new
position when it moves.
