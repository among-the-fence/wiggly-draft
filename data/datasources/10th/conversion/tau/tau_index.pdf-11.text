COMMANDER FARSIGHT
Aggressive and rebellious, Commander O’Shova is the master of the
Mont’ka, the Killing Blow. Piloting his crimson battlesuit he carves a
bloody path into the enemy, leading his separatist Fire Caste forces
and wielding the enigmatic Dawn Blade with such strength and skill
that no foe can stand against him.
