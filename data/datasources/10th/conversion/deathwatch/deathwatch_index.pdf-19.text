Corvus Blackstars are sleek and shrouded aircraft used to insert kill
teams into heavily infested landing zones or even xenos strongholds.
With a barrage of missiles, Blackstars secure aerial supremacy and
sweep the target site clear before firing their hover jets and delivering
their deadly payload of elite warriors.
