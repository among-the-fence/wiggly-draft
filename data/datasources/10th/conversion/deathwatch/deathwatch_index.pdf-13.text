DEATHWATCH VETERANS
Deathwatch Veterans’ skills have been honed in their former Chapter
for decades, sometimes centuries. Throughout their long vigil against
the manifold xenos threats, each Veteran learns to arm himself so as
to best contribute to the mission at hand, and squads carry an array
of weapons to fell any foe.
