VETERAN BIKE SQUAD
Matching their speed, strength and firepower against the swiftest
xenos, Veteran Bikers are expert hunters. Undertaking extended
missions in dangerous territory, they assess their enemy’s every
weakness, close off escape routes and use their velocity to enact
sudden strikes from unexpected angles.
