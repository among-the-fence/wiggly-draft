KHORNE BERZERKERS
Berzerkers of Khorne relish their role as the Blood God’s sacred
destroyers, and are fanatical in the extreme. The warp-fuelled anger
of these psychopathic warriors drives them into an endless frenzy of
action. Those who face them in battle disappear under a rain of heavy
blows, each potent enough to shear limbs and shatter shields.
