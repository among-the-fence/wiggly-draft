WORLD EATERS RHINO
World Eaters Rhinos are well-adapted for battlefield transportation.
Though corrupted by the warp and encrusted with dried blood, they
remain as reliable as ever, safely carrying their passengers over
fire-swept terrain. Many of these vehicles are festooned with blades,
and have machine spirits just as bloodthirsty as their occupants.
