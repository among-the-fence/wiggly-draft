WORLD EATERS DAEMON PRINCE WITH WINGS
Desperate eagerness to kill in Khorne’s name is a trait shared
by all World Eaters Daemon Princes. The blessing of a pair of
powerful, hooked wings is the perfect aid. Descending from the
skies at the speed of bullets, they slam into their enemies, roaring
oaths to Khorne and swearing the doom of those before them.
