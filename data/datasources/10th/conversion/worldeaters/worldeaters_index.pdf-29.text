EXALTED EIGHTBOUND
Some Eightbound reach a level of apotheosis when the soul of the
World Eater they once were becomes one with the eight daemons
sharing their physical form. This only makes them more dangerous.
With no internal competition for control over their body, the Exalted
Eightbound possess a purer kind of rage that is directed at their foes.
