WORLD EATERS DAEMON PRINCE
The trail of blood a World Eater must leave behind him to become
a Daemon Prince is so vast that it could submerge entire worlds.
For their deeds, the Lord of Rage has rewarded them with infernal
immortality and might. In battle, Daemon Princes lead their warbands
in devastating assaults, striding unharmed through enemy attacks.
