WORLD EATERS MAULERFIEND
Maulerfiends stalk the battlefield like immense hunting beasts. With
the enemy in sight, these huge Daemon Engines thunder forward,
even scaling defensive walls in their eagerness to get at their prey.
Once amongst the foe, they slaughter anything in reach with their
huge talons, crushing jaws and lashing tendrils.
