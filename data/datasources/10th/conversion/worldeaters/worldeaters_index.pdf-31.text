WORLD EATERS LAND RAIDER
World Eaters Land Raiders are massive armoured transports bristling
with heavy armaments and seething with a killer spirit. Strung with
trophies taken from those slain by the savage warriors the tanks
carry to the front line, Land Raiders are the gore-encrusted spear-tip of
many World Eaters assaults.
