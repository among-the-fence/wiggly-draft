WORLD EATERS CHAOS SPAWN
Becoming a Chaos Spawn is the dark fate of many upon the Path
to Glory. Wracked with the endless gifts of the Dark Gods, they are
mutated mounds of muscle, writhing pseudopods, slathering maws
and far more. Chaos Spawn are herded towards their terrified foes,
advancing in loping runs, seeking only to tear, crush and consume.
