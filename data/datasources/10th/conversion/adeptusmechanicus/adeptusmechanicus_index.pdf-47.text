SKITARII RANGERS
Rangers relentlessly pursue their quarry over months or even years,
tracking their prey unto death. They bear antique, long-barrelled
galvanic rifles, whose energised ammunition transfers a coruscating
charge when it hits, leaving the prey a smoking husk while the
Rangers are already lining up their next target.
