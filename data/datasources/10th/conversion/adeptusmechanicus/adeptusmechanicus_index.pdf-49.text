SKITARII VANGUARD
The hyper-irradiated shot unleashed by the Skitarii Vanguard’s
carbines ensure those that would otherwise survive the injury still
sicken and die. Vanguard are infused with this radiation, emitting a
debilitating aura they themselves are inured to. This hardens them to
fight in the most toxic war zones to defend the Tech-Priests’ interests.
