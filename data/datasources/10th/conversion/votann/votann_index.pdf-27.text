BRÔKHYR THUNDERKYN
When a Brôkhyr hooks into a powerful exo-frame, they become
Thunderkyn. Adapted from void-rigs used to maintain Kin spacecraft,
these armoured exoskeletons exchange repair tools for massive heavy
weapons, which the Brôkhyr use to lay down withering covering fire for
the Oathbands and to pick off enemy armour.
