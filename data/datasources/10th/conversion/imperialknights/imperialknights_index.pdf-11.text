KNIGHT PALADIN
These highly versatile Knights provide strategic backbone to many
lances. While not specialised, they are favoured by most houses for
their combination rapid-fire battle cannon, a direct firing artillery gun,
and a powerful close combat weapon. Seasoned Nobles prize these
suits, their experience enabling them to get the best use from them.
