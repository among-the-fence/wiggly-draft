ARMIGER HELVERIN
These fast-moving Knights have been designed to lay down hails of
heavy fire, and their strategic roles include enfilading fire, scouting
and anti-air. With their Armiger autocannons they can fire hundreds of
shells per minute, and packs of two or three of these war engines can
shatter an enemy assault in seconds.
