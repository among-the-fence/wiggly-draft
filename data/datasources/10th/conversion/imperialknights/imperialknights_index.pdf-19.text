KNIGHT CRUSADER
Armed with a bristling array of heavy and long-ranged weapons, the
Knight Crusader finds key firing positions and unleashes salvo after
salvo at the enemy. Pilots will gladly steer their suits even into open
ground to find the best place to shoot from, and are regarded as
especially dutiful and selfless by their peers.
