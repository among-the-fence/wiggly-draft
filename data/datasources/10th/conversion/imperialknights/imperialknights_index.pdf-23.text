KNIGHT CASTELLAN
Based around a Dominus-class chassis, the Knight Castellan’s dual
plasma core fuels an array of weapon systems that make it among
the foremost artillery Knights of the houses. The combined fire of
several of these engines can equal that of an Imperial Navy warship
battery, and tear the heart out of an enemy army.
