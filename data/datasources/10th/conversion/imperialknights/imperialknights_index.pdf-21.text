KNIGHT PRECEPTOR
Knights Preceptor are designed to embody the code chivalric.
Their pilots close to an honourable range with the foe, engage with
a respectful force and kill them cleanly with their las-impulsors.
Typically, grizzled veterans pilot these Knights, setting an example for
their younger comrades by hunting down the most fearsome enemies.
