RAVENWING LAND SPEEDER VENGEANCE
With a larger chassis and superior anti-gravity engines, the Land
Speeder Vengeance can mount heavier weaponry than other Land
Speeders, and is thus fitted with a plasma storm battery. In battle,
it uses this to deliver devastating firepower while keeping pace with
even the fastest Ravenwing ground vehicles.
