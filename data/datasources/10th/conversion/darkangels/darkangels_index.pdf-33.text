RAVENWING DARKSHROUD
Borne upon each Darkshroud is a mysterious statue that survived
Caliban’s destruction and became imbued with the energies released
by that fateful event. Through the artifice of the Dark Angels, these
energies are amplified and used to obscure battle-brothers close to
the Darkshroud from enemy sight.
