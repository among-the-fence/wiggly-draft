EZEKIEL
Ezekiel is often at the forefront of battle. As a master of Interromancy,
his warp-whispers claw away the sanity of his enemies. His blade,
known as Traitor’s Bane, was forged to slay those who dared turn
against the Emperor. It is a formidable force weapon that carries within
it the rage of the betrayed.
