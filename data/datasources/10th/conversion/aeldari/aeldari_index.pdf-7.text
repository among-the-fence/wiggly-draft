ASURMEN
Asurmen’s skill at war is breathtaking, the magnitude of his heroic
presence so great that nearby Aspect Warriors are infused with his
peerless tactical acumen. In addition to the wrist-mounted shuriken
catapults known as the Bloody Twins, he carries the Sword of Asur,
whose hilt bears the spirit stone of Asurmen’s brother, Tethesis.
