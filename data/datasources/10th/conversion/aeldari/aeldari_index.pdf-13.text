AUTARCH SKYRUNNER
Autarchs are more than capable of leading their warhosts from the
front, plunging into the fray as Skyrunners astride jetbikes. When
visited by war-lust, they draw upon all the skills they have learnt from
the Aspect Shrines to spearhead assaults, duel enemy leaders and
destroy war machines.
