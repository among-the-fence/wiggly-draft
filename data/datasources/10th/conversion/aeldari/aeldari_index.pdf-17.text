BAHARROTH
Baharroth moves with the grace of a zephyr and attacks with the
force of a hurricane. He shines with a brilliance of his own making in
battle, diving into range, opening fire then peeling away to face his
next quarry. At close quarters he strikes with the resplendent Shining
Blade, lopping off heads with its elegantly curved edge.
