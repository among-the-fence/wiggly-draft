AVATAR OF KHAINE
The Avatar of Khaine is an ancient war deity incarnate, whose mere
presence incites merciless rage in the Asuryani around him. In battle,
the Avatar marches through enemy fire without breaking stride,
laughing cruelly as his weapon – the Wailing Doom – tastes hot flesh
and spurting lifeblood with each swing and thrust.
