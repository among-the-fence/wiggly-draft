INCUBI
The Incubi are warrior-perfectionists of the highest order. Protected by
the ornate plates of their ancient warsuits, they move swiftly in for
the kill, sweeping giant klaives in practised, decapitating strikes. They
carve straight through the enemy’s elite, crushing their spirit with
psychic torture devices known as tormentors.
