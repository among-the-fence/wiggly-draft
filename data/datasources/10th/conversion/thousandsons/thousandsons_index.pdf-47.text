THOUSAND SONS SORCERER
The Sorcerers of the Thousand Sons direct the ranks of Rubricae in
battle. All the while they wield their twisted sorceries to wrack the
foe with rampant mutation, unleash unnatural firestorms upon the
enemy or veil their own warriors behind flickering illusions, protected
throughout by the fickle favour of Tzeentch.
