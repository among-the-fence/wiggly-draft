THOUSAND SONS SORCERER IN TERMINATOR ARMOUR
Clad in hulking Terminator plate, a Sorcerer of the Thousand Sons can shrug off even
the punishing fire of anti-tank weaponry. So protected, they are free to unleash their
mutative magicks with impunity, leading offensives into even the most heavily
defended enemy strongpoints and laying low any who bar their path.
