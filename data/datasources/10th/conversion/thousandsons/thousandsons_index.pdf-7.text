AHRIMAN
Amongst his cursed Legion, Ahriman is second only to his gene-sire in
the potent warp magicks he unleashes in battle. He is a dread sorcerer
and master manipulator, weaving schemes and plots that he enforces
through his cabal of subservient psykers and the ranks of Rubricae
who march at his command.
