EXALTED SORCERER
Greatest amongst Magnus’ lieutenants, each Exalted Sorcerer is an
embodiment of forbidden power and monstrous ambition. From the
soul-burning gouts of their warpflame pistols to the unfettered might
of their sorcery and the shimmering shields cast by their corrupt sigils
of Tzeentch, they are terrifyingly potent warriors.
