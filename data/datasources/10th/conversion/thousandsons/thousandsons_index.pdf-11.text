THOUSAND SONS LAND RAIDER
Chaos Land Raiders employed by the Thousand Sons are slab-sided
armoured monsters commonly employed to bear Scarab Occult
Terminators into battle. Their hulls dance with warpflame or writhe
in constant mutagenic peristalsis, even as their arsenal of heavy
weapons blazes without cease.
