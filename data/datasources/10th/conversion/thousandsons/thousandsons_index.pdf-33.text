THOUSAND SONS HELDRAKE
Swooping low over the battlefield upon flame-wreathed wings,
Heldrakes send their enemies diving for cover. Weaving and jinking
like living beasts, they unleash torrents of fire from their blazing
jaw-guns, tear enemy aircraft from the skies with their vicious
talons, and honour Tzeentch with every sacrificial kill.
