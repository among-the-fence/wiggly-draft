AHRIMAN ON DISC OF TZEENTCH
Ahriman fights with singular focus and frightening determination. At
range he unleashes storms of psychic fury that transmogrify, mutate
and erase from existence all who stand before him. Swooping low upon
his Disc of Tzeentch, the Arch-Sorcerer strikes down any who survive
with his terrifying Black Staff.
