INFERNAL MASTER
Infernal Masters forge pacts with daemonic entities, euphemistically
called tutelaries. Upon the battlefield they can unleash the powers of
these malign familiars to engulf their foes in swarms of momentarily
corporeal terrors, to divine whispers of the future or to master the
currents of the empyrean itself.
