MUTALITH VORTEX BEAST
This foul beast is an offence against sanity and all natural order. Its
constantly mutating form drags in and expels empyric energy in a wild
tempest that twists all about it ever further out of true. Those foes not
driven insane by the monster’s mere presence are soon warped into
fresh horrors by its foul energies.
