TZAANGOR ENLIGHTENED
Most blessed of all their kind, the Enlightened see the skeins of
fate through communion with Tzeentch. They surge to battle atop
daemonic Discs, their divining spears humming as they sense their
predestined prey, their fatecaster greatbows launching ensorcelled
arrows from ectoplasmic strings with lethal effect.
