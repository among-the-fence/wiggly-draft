RUBRIC MARINES
Advancing relentlessly, the Rubric Marines lay down withering hails
of fire. Sorcerous shells from their inferno weapons and soulreaper
cannons blast the enemy apart with ruinous force, while gouts of
mutagenic fire from their warpflamers burn and twist flesh and soul
alike. Against such an onslaught none can stand for long.
