TZAANGORS
Brayhorn blasts and avian shrieks herald the onset of the Tzaangors.
These mutated shock troops surge into battle wielding baroque blades
or roaring chainswords with vicious skill. Return shots and blows
are deflected by whirling skeins of dark sorcery, for these creatures
belong to Tzeentch body and soul.
