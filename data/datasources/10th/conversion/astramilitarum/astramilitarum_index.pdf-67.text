ROGAL DORN BATTLE TANK
The immense Rogal Dorn Battle Tank is a lumbering behemoth equally
suited to anchoring a battle line or grinding forward in support of an
assault. Bristling with immensely powerful guns, they pound breaches
in the foe’s defences with enormous shells and riddle infantry with
storms of bullet-fire.
