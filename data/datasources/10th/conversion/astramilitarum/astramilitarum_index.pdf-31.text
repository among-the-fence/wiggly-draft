INFANTRY SQUAD
The backbone of countless Astra Militarum regiments, these soldiers
fight in huge numbers. Armed with the ubiquitous lasgun, often
supplemented with specialist weapons, they hold defensive lines,
conduct massed assaults across no man’s land and, if well led, will
hold their ground to the last.
