CHIMERA
A workhorse armoured troop carrier, the Chimera is a durable and
practical tank, employed to ferry infantry into the harshest war zones.
While embarked, its passengers operate the tank’s in-built lasgun
arrays in safety; once they dismount, the Chimera provides fire
support with its versatile heavy weapons.
