HELLHOUND
Hellhounds are terrifying close assault tanks, designed to flush
enemies out of dense terrain with gouts of promethium, clouds of
noxious gas or the searing touch of thermal weaponry. Those few who
volunteer to serve in these tanks often have a cavalier attitude, and
revel in their reputation for reckless destruction.
