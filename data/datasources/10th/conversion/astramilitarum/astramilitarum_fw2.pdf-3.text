VOSS-PATTERN LIGHTNING
Smaller and more agile than the iconic Thunderbolt, the Lightning is
a high-speed suborbital fighter designed for interception, interdiction
and surgical strikes. The Lightning’s hellstrike missiles, coupled
with lascannons, ensure that few ground targets are safe from its
swooping assaults.
