OGRYN BODYGUARD
Ogryn Bodyguards are particularly capable warriors of their kind who
have but one duty – to protect the officer to whom they are assigned.
Whether by throwing themselves in the line of fire or slaughtering all
enemies who come near their ward, they are invaluable retainers in
the swirl of battlefield combat.
