PRIMARIS PSYKER
Primaris Psykers’ empyrically attuned minds are steeled against the
manifold dangers risked by unsanctioned wielders of warp powers.
These battle-trained psykers support the Astra Militarum’s wars with
eerie foretelling, warding soldiers against the enemy’s witchcraft and
unleashing tempests of their own psychic might.
