TROJAN SUPPORT VEHICLE
Astra Militarum armoured companies and artillery regiments depend
upon an extensive corps of support vehicles for their maintenance and
rearmament. Amongst these is the Trojan; a crane-armed ammo mule
tasked with keeping big guns firing, whether by replenishing supplies
of shells and fuel or by facilitating simple battlefield repairs.
