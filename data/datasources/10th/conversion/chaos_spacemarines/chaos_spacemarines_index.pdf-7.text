ABADDON THE DESPOILER
The Warmaster of Chaos is the greatest threat to the Imperium. He
rules his Black Legion with an iron-taloned fist and stands as the
embodiment of the Long War. Clad in Terminator armour and wielding
his howling daemon sword, Drach’nyen, Abaddon slays any weakling
champions sent to challenge him.
