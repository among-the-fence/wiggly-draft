The Kharybdis is a powerful ship-to-ship assault pod able to insert a large complement of
Heretic Astartes warriors into enemy vessels or war zones on the ground. Far more than
a simple shuttle, the Kharybdis is also a threat in its own right, capable of showering
target areas with its storm launchers or even ramming enemy vehicles and burning
through thick steel and ceramite with melta cutters designed to breach starships.
