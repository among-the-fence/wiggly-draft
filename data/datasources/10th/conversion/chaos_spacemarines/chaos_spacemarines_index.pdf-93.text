KHORNE LORD OF SKULLS
Lords of Skulls are insane, monolithic creations fuelled by boiling
blood and dedicated to slaughtering in the name of Khorne. They
plough through the enemy’s ranks, crushing infantry beneath their
tracks, hacking tanks into kindling with sweeps of their cleaver and
hurling brazen projectiles or burning ichor at the survivors.
