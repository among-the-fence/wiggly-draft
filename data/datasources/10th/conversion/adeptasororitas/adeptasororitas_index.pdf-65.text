SORORITAS RHINO
Rhinos are the mainstay transport of the Adepta Sororitas, and before
battle are blessed by Enginseers and Ministorum priests. They are
durable, robust and easy to operate. Thanks to their indomitable
machine spirits they rarely break down, and speed the warriors inside
them across the battlefield wherever they are needed.
