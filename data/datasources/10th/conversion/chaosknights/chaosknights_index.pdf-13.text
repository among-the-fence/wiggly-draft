WAR DOG BRIGAND
Between them, Brigands and their Fallen Noble pilots have become
so enamoured of the skilful, ranged kill that they mostly disdain the
chaos of close assaults. Some even swear dark pacts compelling them
to slay potent foes with elegance, or else to purge war zones of all life
with sweeping contempt.
