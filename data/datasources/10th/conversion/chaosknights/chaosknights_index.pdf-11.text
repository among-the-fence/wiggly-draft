WAR DOG KARNIVORE
Aggressive and bloodthirsty, Karnivores eschew the more potent
ranged weapons of the War Dog chassis. They revel in causing
bloody confusion and despair, seeking the visceral thrill that only
close-quarters slaughter provides. As a result, many of their pilots fall
to the open worship of one of the Chaos Gods.
