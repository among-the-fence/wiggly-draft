WAR DOG EXECUTIONER
Methodical and coldly emotionless killers, Fallen Nobles who pilot
War Dog Executioners employ long-barrelled, rapid-firing cannons
to maximise their kills. They eviscerate throngs of the enemy and
hammer the foes’ war engines into submission, seeking to reap ever
greater murderous tallies than their peers.
