ATALAN JACKALS
Atalan Jackals share a mental link that allows them to coordinate
in hunting packs and ride in tight formations at high speeds with
no risk of mishap. They harass the foe with hit-and-run strikes,
their Wolfquads unleashing heavy firepower to augment the guns,
bludgeons and mining charges of their packmates.
