SHIELD-CAPTAIN
Shield-Captains are among the greatest warriors in the Imperium.
No matter which weapons they wield, they display absolute mastery
of them. Their tactical and strategic abilities know few peers, and
they read the ebb and flow of a war at a glance before directing their
forces accordingly.
