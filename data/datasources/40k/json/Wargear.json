    "legend": "The Staganda War was one of the most gruelling campaigns undertaken by the Imperial Fists. Staganda had been severed from Mankind since the Dark Age of Technology and, by the time an Explorator fleet rediscovered the world, the population had been living under brutal Ork occupation for millennia. Though the entire Imperial Fists Chapter was mobilised to reclaim the planet, it was the 3rd Company that bore the brunt of the fighting. In the aftermath, a new standard was fashioned in honour of this epic victory."

The toppling of the Gallowfortress, the sundering of the Inimical Gate and the single-handed liberation of Shormidar – all of these are deeds attributed to Osrak that may have grown in the telling. Whatever the truth of these stories, none contest Osrak’s sheer psychic might. Even now, centuries after his death, the scrimshawed remains of his skull radiate a formidable power. With proper training, a Librarian of the same gene-seed can bend the Bones of Osrak to his will, accomplishing feats beyond the ken of his fellow psykers."

It is a great honour and responsibility to bring such an artefact to war, and should the bearer fall in battle, it is said the Votann themselves will wreak their vengeance upon the foe."
